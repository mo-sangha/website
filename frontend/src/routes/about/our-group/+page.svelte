			We have been meditating online since 2013, having started off on Reddit's /r/Buddhism
			subreddit as "redditations." Our online sessions are safe spaces where you can join us from
			anywhere in the world, completely for free. There is no expectation of donations or payment of
			any kind. We are a community of people who are interested in meditation and mindfulness, and
			we're happy to have you join us.
		</p>
		<p>
			This group is intended to be all inclusive and modern in the sense of creating a new kind of
			space. Every person can have a voice and a kind of ownership within the group. Traditionally
			it's known that every sentient being is ultimately a Buddha so in that sense we can empower
			one another with minimum use of hierarchy while still preserving lineage and transmission. A
			grass roots, very human, and accessible approach presented in harmony with modern science and
			traditional methodology.
		</p>

		<p>
			The lineage and transmission is very important with practices like Dzogchen, Mahamudra and
			Zen. Our group is hosted by <a class="link-hover text-secondary" href="/about/dawai-gocha"
				>dawai</a
			>, who is a Getting empowerments from living recognized masters, following your teachers
			advice, and doing any preliminary practices is recommended. If the practitioner is ready then
			they can begin awareness practices which, in a modern sense, can start with an introduction to
			awareness.
		</p>

		<p>Please come and go as you feel, there are no rules about attendance.</p>
