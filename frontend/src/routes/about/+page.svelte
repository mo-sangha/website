		<p>
			This group is intended to be all inclusive and modern in the sense of creating a new kind of
			space. Every person can have a voice and a kind of ownership within the group. Traditionally
			it's known that every sentient being is ultimately a Buddha so in that sense we can empower
			one another with minimum use of hierarchy while still preserving lineage and transmission. A
			grass roots, very human, and accessible approach presented in harmony with modern science and
			traditional methodology.
		</p>

		<p>
			The lineage and transmission is very important with practices like Dzogchen, Mahamudra and
			Zen. Getting empowerments from living recognized masters, following your teachers advice, and
			doing any preliminary practices is recommended. If the practitioner is ready then they can
			begin awareness practices which, in a modern sense, can start with an introduction to
			awareness.
		</p>

		<p>Please come and go as you feel, there are no rules about attendance.</p>

			<p>I grew up Buddhist. My mom raised me in the Nyingma Buddhist lineage.</p>

				For me, meditation is learning to play your own music. Our emotions and mental tendencies
				get strummed like guitar strings. I even started calling emotions the “E String” and
				cognitive activity the “C String.”
			</p>

			<p>
				But the problem for me was that I had no control over the music I was playing. So meditation
				became about settling into the “body of the guitar,” coming out of the dense dimension of
				preoccupation with the “strings” and settling into a more natural state. From there I feel
				open and free to choose what gets played on the guitar and I can let creativity, celebration
				and joy manifest as my song!
