			His Holiness Penor Rinpoche (Tib. པད་ནོར་རིན་པོ་ཆེ་, Wyl. pad nor rin po che) or Kyabjé
			Drubwang Pema Norbu Rinpoche (1932-2009) was one of the most well-known Nyingma and Dzogchen
			masters of the twentieth century. Rinpoche was the third head of the Nyingma school of Tibetan
			Buddhism and the eleventh throne-holder of the Palyul lineage. Considered an incarnation of
			Vimalamitra, Rinpoche received his full spiritual training in Tibet before escaping to India
			in 1959. He subsequently established Namdroling Monastery in Southern India and also taught
			extensively throughout the world. Rinpoche had many Tibetan and international students, and in
			the 1980s he recognized the first Western female reincarnate lama, Jetsunma Ahkon Lhamo (Alyce
			Louise Zeoli).
